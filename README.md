# Power-Domination-Throttling
Computational analysis of the power domination throttling number of a graph

The files order1AM.txt through order9AM.txt contain adjacency matrix representations of all graphs under 10 vertices. Run main() in throttling.c to generate the power throttling numbers of these graphs (the output text files order1PTH.txt through order9PTH.txt are already in the repository). To compute the power throttling number of an arbitrary graph, run pth() in throttling.c.

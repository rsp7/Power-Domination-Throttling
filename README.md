# Power-Domination-Throttling
Computational analysis of the power domination throttling number of a graph

The files order1AM.txt through order9AM.txt contain adjacency matrix representations of all graphs on less than 10 vertices. Run main() in throttling.c to generate the power domination throttling numbers of these graphs (for convenience, the output files order1PTH.txt through order9PTH.txt are already in the repository). To compute the power domination throttling number of an arbitrary graph, call pth() in throttling.c with the specified arguments.
